# Some common problems

##  Why there is no reward

Why the proof was found, but the coins were not obtainedï¼Ÿ

The most likely thing is that your wallet has not been synchronized yet, and the rewards won will only be displayed if the wallet is synchronized.  

In another case, the reward address of the farm is not your current wallet address. It often appears on people with two wallets(check your another wallet)  

## How to sync quickly?

The sync is too slow and the coins are token by others, what should I do? The quickest way is to directly use the synchronized DB file. The method of use is as follows:

1. Close the software after successful installation of Lucky

2. Download the DB folder

3. Replace the local DB folder

The local DB file path is generally: C:\Users\tony\\.lucky\mainnet\  **tony** is the user name of your computer

## How to get more coins

In the case that the plots file remains unchanged, you can get a higher probability of block explosions by making yourself a shared node

There are several ways to share your own nodes:

1. Port mapping (port:16664)

2. DMZ

3. upnp
